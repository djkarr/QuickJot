# Quick! Jot

A note taking app for quickly jotting down an idea before you forget it. The inspiration behind it was to have an edit screen appear as soon as the app launched, saving the time of having to create a new note/file. Categorizing is optional and starts with a default value. 
Uses Room Persistence Library to interact with SQLite database.
